// Command line based to-do list
// Ask user what they would like to do.
// 4 options:
//  - new - add a todo. After input, update console confirming the list addition.
//  - list - list all todos
//  - delete - remove specific todo, based on the items index. Ack with "todo removed"
//  - quit - quit app

// Tips:
// 1. Ask for input. While input is not equal to quit, take action as outlined above. 
//      (implement quit first)
// 2. Store todos in an array.
// 3. Use splice to remove items from array.
