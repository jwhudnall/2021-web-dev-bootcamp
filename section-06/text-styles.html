    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are marine <a href="#nowhere">molluscs</a> of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda,
        which also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone,
        which is used for control of buoyancy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers,
        with which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest
        species, Sepia apama, reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.[3]
    </p>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators
        include
        dolphins, sharks, fish, seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The average life expectancy of a cuttlefish is
        about
        1â€“2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent invertebrates.[4] Cuttlefish
        also
        have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.[4]

    <p>
        The "cuttle" in cuttlefish comes from the Old English name for the species, cudele, which may be cognate with
        the Old
        Norse koddi (cushion) and the Middle Low German Kudel (rag).[5] The Greco-Roman world valued the cuttlefish as a
        source
        of the unique brown pigment the creature releases from its siphon when it is alarmed. The word for it in both
        Greek and
        Latin, sepia, now refers to the reddish-brown color sepia in English.

    <h2>Fossil Record</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The earliest fossils of cuttlefish are from the Cretaceous period.[6][7] represented by Ceratisepia from the Late
        Maastrichtian-Paleocene.[8] Whether the earlier Trachyteuthis is assigned to this order, or to the
        Octopodiformes, remains unclear.[9]
    </p>
    <h2>Range and Habitat</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and temperate ocean waters. They are
        mostly shallow-water animals,
        although they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).[10] They have an unusual biogeographic
        pattern: they are present along
        the coasts of East and South Asia, Western Europe, and the Mediterranean, as well as all coasts of Africa and
        Australia, but are totally
        absent from the Americas. By the time the family evolved, ostensibly in the Old World, the North Atlantic
        possibly had become too cold and
        deep for these warm-water species to cross.[11] The common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), is found in the
        Mediterranean, North and Baltic
        seas, although populations may occur as far south as South Africa. They are found in sublittoral depths, between
        the low tide line and the
        edge of the continental shelf, to about 180 m (600 ft).[12] The cuttlefish is listed under the Red List category
        of "least concern" by the
        IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This means that while some over-exploitation of the marine animal has
        occurred in some regions due to
        large-scale commercial fishing, their wide geographic range prevents them from being too threatened. Ocean
        acidification, however, caused
        largely by higher levels of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere, is cited as a potential threat.[13]
